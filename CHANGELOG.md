* feature: add Section numbers to the HTML/PDF output using CSS
* fix: logger must be passed through as argument in lib/tools.js
* feature: support dark mode via CSS `var(--color-canvas-default)`
* fix: in some occasions, the path of cookies registered in the log was wrong, so that cookies from the log and from the storage would not be matched as the same cookie
* fix: non-compliant cookie headers such as ` ; sameSite=None` with no key are discarded from the logging and matching
* feature: add clickable anchors to all sections in the html output with AnchorJS
* feature: add config object to output

* feature: generate automatically inspection.docx in output folder. Use `--office-template [file]` to change the respective pug template. Use `--use-pandoc` to generate the docx with [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) (needs to be installed separately) instead of [html-to-docx](https://github.com/privateOmega/html-to-docx).
